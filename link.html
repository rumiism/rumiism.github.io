                                    <p>When  you do things from your soul, you feel a river
                                        moving in you, a joy.</p>

                                        others lead you.  They may be blind or, worse, vultures.
                                        Reach for the rope
                                     
                                    of God.  And what is that?  Putting aside self-will.</p>

                                    Because of willfulness
                                     
                                    people sit in jail, the trapped bird's wings are tied,
                                    fish sizzle in the skillet.
                                     
                                    The anger of police is willfulness.  You've seen a magistrate

                                    would see how you've
                                     
                                    been torturing your soul.  We are born and live inside black water in a well.
                                     
                
                                    How could we know what an open field of sunlight is? Don't
                                    insist on going where
                                     
                                    you think you want to go.  Ask the way to the spring.  Your

                                    a harmony.

                                    There is a moving palace that floats in the air
