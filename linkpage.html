								Irimi (ee-ree-mee) is the second pillar of Aikido (Aikido techniques are structured 
								around six main pillars). Irimi involves entering deeply around or behind an attack 
								to defuse or neutralize the attack. The concept of irimi teaches one to blend with 
								or enter into an opponent’s attack to become one with the opponent’s 
								movement and leaving the opponent with nowhere to strike.
